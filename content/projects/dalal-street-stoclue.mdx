### Idea

I found a problem that retail investors don't have a online community where they can hang around and talk about stock market.
So, I decided to make it.

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
- TypeORM

### Features

- Beautiful User Interface
- Users can signup/login (http cookie based authentication)
- Users can post their views about a stock under a particular stock community group
- Users can make thier own stock community
- Users can change banner image and profile image of their community(if and only if they own it)
- Top communities are shown in the sidebar which has most interations
- Users can go to their profile route and see their all comments and posts
- Users can comment and engage with others
- Users can vote on any comment and post
- Users can search communities based on their interest
